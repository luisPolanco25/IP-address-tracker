# Ip Address Tracker

![Design preview for the Insure landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

IP Address Tracker app created with two separate APIs together. This project was made with HTML, CSS Flexbox and React.js. The main API I'm using is <a href="https://geo.ipify.org/">IP Geolocation API</a> and for the map I'm using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> and <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org/">React-leaflet.</a>
